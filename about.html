        <h2>My passion</h2>
        <div class="passion-paragraph">
          <p>
            I love helping people in general! I usually do not specially carve
            out time to volunteer, but I help the people around me whenever I
            can 😊. Be it being a listening ear or helping individuals find
            their way around the neighbourhood, I enjoy helping anyone within my
            abilities❤️!

        <h2>My hobbies</h2>
        <p>
          In my free time, I mainly paint using poster colours 🎨. It is really
          a time-consuming past-time as hours must be set aside for me to enjoy
          the process of mixing colours and applying them on canvas. (Maybe I am
          just not skillful enough to complete an aesthetic piece in a short
          time 😢.)

          Recently, I am in the midst of discovering colouring with crayons 🖍️.
          (I will upload the pieces soon once I am done 😊.)
        </p>

        <p>
          I also love to dance free-style in my own room! The ability to move my
          body freely is just so liberating and it has given me the sense of
          hope that I can control my body and mind 💃.

          Recently, I have graduated from
          <a href="https://eunoiajc.moe.edu.sg/"> Eunoia Junior College </a>
          (EJC). These 2 years (2021 - 2022) have been really challenging but it
          was fruitful to go through the "Tough times don't last, tough people
          do" era 💪.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was also a member of Eunoia Drama. I am really grateful for my
          instructor, teachers-in-charge and peers for always supporting me and
          nurture me to become a more confident individual 🥰. Shoutout to my
          batchmates in Drama to making this tertiary education journey much
          more bearable as we shared all the good and bad times!
        </p>

          From 2017 to 2020, I have spent my developing years in
          <a href="https://chijstnicholasgirls.moe.edu.sg/secondary/">
            CHIJ St Nicholas Girls' School
          </a>
          . I really enjoyed building relationships with my teachers and peers,
          as well as constantly improving myself as a person.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a member of
          <a href="https://stjohn.org.sg/"> St John Singapore </a>
          , I was fortunate enough to represent Singapore with my school team in
          the 32nd Malaysia-Singapore First-Aid and Nursing Competition in the
          Nursing Cadet Category in 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sisterly love culture is so heartwarming, where we call one
          another "姐姐" (elder sister) and "妹妹" (younger sister). What I
          really miss is the morning and afternoon prayers in school which kept
          my mind at ease ❤️.
