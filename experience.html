                I started my business in the field of health & wellness as well

                  From April 2023 to July 2023, I have experience in preparing
                  school science laboratory materials as a Relief Lab
                  Technician. Furthermore, I went back to my alma-mater to help
                  out! It was a total different experience from being a student
                  having your lessons in the laboratory doing different
                  experiments because I got to experience how it's like to
                  prepare the lesson/exam materials beforehand.

                  Operating Support Staff (OSO) in charge of the labs, as well

          The recent leadership opportunity that shaped me into an individual
          who can better understand others' situations is being a Project Lead
          for Junior College 2 Ora House-based Values-in-Action (VIA) Activity
          on Deep Dive Day 2 2022 in Eunoia Junior College (EJC).
        </p>

        <p>
          From crafting the initial proposal to collating ideas and feedback
          from our beneficiary, the Non-Teaching Staff (NTS) in EJC, and finally
          executing the individualised activities for each class, it was a
          fruitful journey for me. It was not easy to negotiate and not miss out
          the different stakeholders' intentions and resources when
          communicating with them. Through this journey of leading, the
          importance of mindful listening was the most significant lesson
          learnt.
        </p>

        <p>
          Besides, there were also some unexpected problems that surfaced
          though, such me falling sick for 2 weeks. This pushed back the
          execution of tasks that are supposed to be carried out in these 2
          weeks. Thankfully, tasks were planned ahead so we were not behind time
          by a lot. From this snippet, I have learnt that ahead-of-time planning
          is necessary, but adaptability will also be an essential asset for a
          leader.
