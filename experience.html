                I started my business in the field of health & wellness as well
                as skincare & beauty mid 2023. I aspire to build a community

                healthy when their bodies, hearts and minds are aligned, with
                the natural radiance that comes from within.

        <h2 id="tutoring">Tutoring</h2>

        <p>
          Since August 2023, I have been tutoring primary school and secondary
          school students. At first, it simply saw the opportunity as a way to
          make an additional source of income. Along the way, I have interacted
          with students from all walks of life. It is always heartwarming to see
          that they are putting in the effort to improve themselves.
        </p>

        <p>
          Interacting with younger children helps me reflect. As people around
          them, we can have a significant impact on these younger beings,
          whether we are conscious of it or not. Every encouragement can serve
          as a motivation for them to work harder, and play an important role to
          fulfill their potential. It is crucial to be careful with how we make
          them feel through our words and actions as it can shape their
          perceptions, which ultimately shape their beliefs and values.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is meaningful to empower these children to realise what they are
          capable of and achieve what they can. By helping these children in
          their academics as well as instilling hope and confidence in them at
          the same time makes this journey extremely fulfilling! 🥰

        <p>
          BrainHack is unique hands-on experience for secondary school students
          and up, to provide a platform for students to explore the future of
          digital technology. Students get to dive into the realms of
          Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, Space Tech, Software
          Development, Robotics and many more.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our group joined the SpaceCube competition, which is challenge
          revolving around Space Tech. We get to explore space technology and
          compete to assemble and integrate a CubeSat. Going into the compete
          with no prior knowledge actually made the process of learning and
          tackling the issues at hand a humbling one! Although our group didn't
          win any prizes, we truly enjoyed one another's company and took home
          many knowledge and skills with us. 🛰️

              We had a chance to take a picture with the first female commercial
              spaceship pilot and the first artist selected to go to be an
              astronaut on the all-civilian Inspiration4 orbital spaceflight.
              Such a pleasure to meet her!

                  From April 2023 to July 2023, I have experience in preparing
                  school science laboratory materials as a Relief Lab
                  Technician. Furthermore, I went back to my alma-mater to help
                  out! It was a total different experience from being a student
                  having your lessons in the laboratory doing different
                  experiments because I got to experience how it's like to
                  prepare the lesson/exam materials beforehand.

          A leadership opportunity that shaped me into an individual who can
          better understand others' situations is being a Project Lead for
          Junior College 2 Ora House-based Values-in-Action (VIA) Activity on
          Deep Dive Day 2 2022 in Eunoia Junior College (EJC).
        </p>

        <p>
          From crafting the initial proposal to collating ideas and feedback
          from our beneficiary, the Non-Teaching Staff (NTS) in EJC, and finally
          executing the individualised activities for each class, it was a
          fruitful journey for me. It was not easy to negotiate and not miss out
          the different stakeholders' intentions and resources when
          communicating with them. Through this journey of leading, the
          importance of mindful listening was the most significant lesson
          learnt.
        </p>

        <p>
          Besides, there were also some unexpected problems that surfaced
          though, such me falling sick for 2 weeks. This pushed back the
          execution of tasks that are supposed to be carried out in these 2
          weeks. Thankfully, tasks were planned ahead so we were not behind time
          by a lot. From this snippet, I have learnt that ahead-of-time planning
          is necessary, but adaptability will also be an essential asset for a
          leader.
