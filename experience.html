        <p>
          Recently, I have just graduated from SheCodes, where I was learning
          the basics of front-end web development. I really love their courses
          even though they are all online (because I prefer face-to-face
          courses)! Besides having the freedom to go through the lessons at my
          own pace, the weekly lessons are split into tasks with

            in December 2021. During this internship, I was involved with
            extracting classified company data from Microsoft Excel and
            importing them into QlikSense to help with data visualisation and
            analysis.

      <h2>Leadership</h2>

        </div>
        <p>
          The recent leadership opportunity that shaped me into an individual
          who can better understand others' situations is being a Project Lead
          for Junior College 2 Ora House-based Values-in-Action (VIA) Activity
          on Deep Dive Day 2 2022 in Eunoia Junior College (EJC).
        </p>

        <p>
          From crafting the initial proposal to collating ideas and feedback
          from our beneficiary, the Non-Teaching Staff (NTS) in EJC, and finally
          executing the individualised activities for each class, it was a
          fruitful journey for me. It was not easy to negotiate and not miss out
          the different stakeholders' intentions and resources when
          communicating with them. Through this journey of leading, the
          importance of mindful listening was the most significant lesson
          learnt.
        </p>

        <p>
          Besides, there were also some unexpected problems that surfaced
          though, such me falling sick for 2 weeks. This pushed back the
          execution of tasks that are supposed to be carried out in these 2
          weeks. Thankfully, tasks were planned ahead so we were not behind time
          by a lot. From this snippet, I have learnt that ahead-of-time planning
          is necessary, but adaptability will also be an essential asset for a
          leader.
